# Multi-agent reinforcement learning applied to construction 

## Training environment pages
To train robots to build structures, we developed two suites of environments. Each of these environments can be modeled as MDP, and out of the box RL algorithms can be used to solve them.

[3D environment suite](./3Denv.markdown)

## Coordination between agent
As a close collaboration is needed between each robot, a centralized and asynchronous approach was chosen.
