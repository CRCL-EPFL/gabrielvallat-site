# Hex environment
This set of environment is using isometric blocks to build spanning structures

{% include hexenv_largegap.html %}

Different environments (compatible with [gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) for easy training) were created, and are available on [github](https://github.com/sycamore-lab-EPFL/StaticSimulatorEnvs/tree/master)

## State

## Action

## State transition

## Reward
The base reward is a simple binary {-1, 1} terminal reward, but helper rewards were manually designed to help the learning. 

An environment was also created to optimize the load bearing and pertubations during fabrication. This work, done by Marcel Garrobe, is detailed on [this page]()
